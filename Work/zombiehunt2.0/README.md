University of Minnesota Coding Boot Camp, October 2018

by Joseph Dinh, Alex Henderson, Adam Olson & Nick Sedillos

- Repository: https://github.com/olsoa4/zombiehunt2.0
- Deployment: https://zombiehunt.herokuapp.com/

## Description

…

## Parameters

Given requirements were that the project must:

- Use a Node and Express Web Server;
- Be backed by a MySQL Database and ORM (not necessarily Sequelize);
- Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data;
- Be deployed using Heroku (with Data);
- Utilize at least one new library, package, or technology that we haven’t discussed;
- Have a polished frontend / UI;
- Have folder structure that meets MVC Paradigm;
- Meet good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming).
- Must not expose sensitive API key information on the server

## Approach

Our first decision as a group was to attempt to learn and use React for our frontend. Based on that choice and building off our game design document and pseudocode, we tried a few different ideas before settling on Firebase as a backend solution based on its simplicity and ability to update in realtime.

## Future development

Features we would like to add in future versions include:

- User authentication
- Room for additional players as both "humans" and "zombies"
- Futher refinement of the UI
- Vision/fog
